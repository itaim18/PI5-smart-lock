# PI5- Smart Lockü§ñüîê‚Äã
To continue developing your smart lock system, follow these steps:

### 1. **Connect the Smart Lock to the Door**
   - **Choose a Lock Mechanism**: Select an electronic door lock that supports GPIO input or works via protocols like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Zigbee.
   - **Relay Module**: If using a GPIO-controlled lock, connect a relay module to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to actuate the lock.
   - **Test Lock Control**: Write a script (e.g., Python) to toggle the relay or send commands to the lock based on facial recognition success.

### 2. **Integrate Server Communication**
   - **Choose a Server Framework**: Decide between a cloud-based server or a local server hosted on the Raspberry Pi or a separate machine.
   - **Server Setup**:
     - Use Flask, FastAPI, or Django for a lightweight Python server.
     - Store data (e.g., log entries) in a database like SQLite, MySQL, or Firebase.
   - **API Integration**:
     - Create APIs for logging entries, retrieving logs, and sending updates to the app/website.
     - Use `requests` library in Python to communicate with the server.

### 3. **Implement Real-Time Monitoring**
   - **WebSocket or Push Notifications**: To report entrances instantly, implement WebSocket communication or use push notifications for mobile apps.
   - **UI for Monitoring**:
     - Build a dashboard for your website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
     - Use a mobile app framework like Flutter or React Native for mobile applications.

### 4. **Improve Facial Recognition Accuracy**
   - **Train a Custom Model**: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to improve facial recognition accuracy with your dataset.
   - **Optimize Detection**: Leverage pre-trained models like OpenCV's `dlib` or deep learning-based tools for higher accuracy and speed.
   - **Add Security Thresholds**: Set thresholds for accuracy levels to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5. **Implement Security Measures**
   - **Encryption**: Encrypt all communication between the smart lock, the server, and the app using HTTPS and protocols like TLS.
   - **Logging & Notifications**: Log all access attempts and send notifications for failed authentication attempts.

### 6. **Build the Reporting System**
   - **Database Schema**: Store logs with fields like timestamp, detected face, and action (allowed/denied).
   - **Dashboard Analytics**: Provide summary analytics such as daily entry counts, frequent users, and unusual access times.
   - **Export Logs**: Allow logs to be exported as CSV or viewed directly on the app/website.

### 7. **Test the System**
   - **Simulate Scenarios**: Test different access scenarios and handle edge cases.
   - **Stress Testing**: Check the performance under high traffic or rapid consecutive attempts.
